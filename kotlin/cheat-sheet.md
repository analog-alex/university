# Kotlin Cheat Sheet


## Intro

*Kotlin* is a JVM based (but has since slouched beyond the JVM) language that modernizes the syntax and verbosity of the usual statically-typed, object-oriented, "enterprise", _C-like_, Java and C#.

In its JVM form it has full interoperability with the Java ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

It is used widely in Mobile and Back-End development, even recently becoming the primary language for the Android SDK development.

## The Basics

### The basic types

*this part is easy*ðŸ˜…

| Kotlin type   | Java relative |  Brief description    |
| ------------- |:-------------:|:-------------------------------:| 
| Byte          | byte          |    8bits _[-127, 128]_          |
| Short         | short         |    16bits _[-32768, 32768]_     |
| Int           | int           |    32bits _[-2^31, 2^31]_       |
| Long          | long          |    64bits _[-2^63, 2^63]_       |
| Float         | float         |    32bits                       |
| Double        | double        |    64bits                       |
| Char          | char          |    represents a single charachter (e.g. '1' or 'a')    |
| String        | String        |     an immutable String of characters   |
| Boolean       | boolean       |    truth value i.e. *true* or *false*   |
| Array<T>      | T[]           |    a memory-contiguous collection of types    |


### Declarations

In Kotlin, declaring simple types is done in the following fashion:
[val|var] [name] : [type]

Where *val* indicates a immutable value and *var* a variable (_as the name indicates_) one. 

```kotlin
val one: Integer = 1
val one = 1 // type can be omitted when it can be inferred from the context. 
```

Note that in all cases the terminating semi-colon (;) can be omitted in Kotlin.

Other variations include *const val* indicating a constant value present at compile time (i.e. cannot be attibuted by a function) and *lateinit var* for variables initialized by dependency injections or in other _setup_ methods.

---

Functions follow a similar pattern, but with the reserved _keyword_ *fun*
*fun* [name] ([*args]+) : [return type]

```kotlin
fun sucessor(number: Int): Int {
  //... function body
  return number + 1
}
```

### String Interpolation

```kotlin
val name = "Miguel"
val age = 28

val interpolation = "My name is $name and I'm $age years old. I'm ${ 30 - age } from my thirties."
```

### Loops and Ranges

Loops in Kotlin are pretty standard.
Note the *println* function that writes to standard output.

```kotlin

val names = listOf("Miguel", "Rafael", "Gabriel")
for(name in names) { 
  println(name)
}

var x = 0
while (x < 10) {
    println(x)
    x++ 
}

```

One can use streams just like in Java. They are specially useful when collections are involved.

```kotlin

val addOneAndCountEvenNumbers: Int = (1..100).map { it + 1 }.filter { it % 2 == 0 }.size
val sumOfNumbersFromOneToOneHundred = (1..100).reduce { a, i -> a + 1 }
```

### Collections

There is quite a practical distinction explicit in Kotlin collections, specially _vis-a-vis_ Java / C# standards between *mutable* and *immutable* collections. To wit, with an immutable collection, after it is initialised, it is impossible to add any more elements.

Below we run through some examples:

```kotlin

val names = listOf("Miguel", "Gabriel", "Rafael") // immutable
val numbers: List<Int> = listOf<Int>()

val miguel: String = names[0]

val names = mutableListOf("Miguel", "Gabriel", "Rafael") // mutable
names.add("Manuel")

val set = setOf(1, 1, 2, 3)
val map = hashMapOf(1 to "Pizza", 2 to "Hamburger")

val pizza: String = map[1]

```

### Classes and Inheritance

Kotlin removes some boilerplate when it comes to class declarations. Data classes allow one to quickly build container classes without having to specify getters & setters, hashCodes, equals and toString functions because those are automatically generated by the compiler. Public, Protected, and Private keywords are reserved to represent access levels to class properties and methods. 

One thing to note in relation to inheritance is that in Kotlin all classes and class methods are non-virtual, that is *final* by default unlike in, say, Java. So the key word **open** must be applied to those classes AND to class methods one wishes to be made overridable.

Below we run by some basic patterns:

```kotlin

class Person(val name: String, var age: Int)

data class User(val username: String, val password: String)
//... Getters & Setters, HashCode(), Equals(), toString() and Copy() automatically generated

class Human(val name: String) {

  // redundant getter and setter
  val age: Int = 0
    get() = field
    set(value) {
      field = value
    } 
    
 val isUnderage: Boolean
    get() = this.age <= 18
}

open class Animal
class Dog : Animal()
class Cat: Animal()

// more polymorphism
open class Car (protected val speed: Int) {
    open fun race(): String {
        return "This car goes at $speed kph"
    }
}

class Ferrari : Car(speed = 100) {
    override fun race(): String {
        return "This Ferrari goes at $speed kph"
    }
}

class Ford : Car(speed = 50) {
    override fun race(): String {
        return "This Ford goes at $speed kph"
    }
}

val cars = mutableListOf<Car>()
cars.add(Ferrari())
cars.add(Ford())

cars.forEach { println(it.race()) }
// This Ferrari goes at 100 kph
// This Ford goes at 50 kph
```

### Nullable types

Any type can be made to be nullable by adding a question mark to its type declaration e.g. Int?, String?, ...
Null checks are chainable and Kotlin scope function come in handy to work with them! 

```kotlin
val name: String = null // will not compile
val name: String? = null

val otherName: String? = "A name"

if(otherName) {
  // other name was cast from String? to String
}

// null checks are chainable
class Person (val name: String)
val person = // ....
val name = person?.name

person?.let {
  person.name = "A name"
}

val name: person?.name ?: "Person is null"

// scope functions clear up the code
person?.name?.takeIf {
  it == "A name"
}.let {
  println("Found!)
}
```
