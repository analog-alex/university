## Intro

From wiki:
> TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs. 

In other words, **Typescript** is a super-set of **Javascript**, adding `types` and transpile-time type-checking as well as some extra syntax and sugar.
